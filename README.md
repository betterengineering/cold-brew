Cold Brew is a project to control a kyoto cold brew tower via software.

## Project Status
This was originally a successful hackweek project at my current place of
employment. I am currently in the process of refactoring code and gathering a
group of resources (documentation, release pipelines, wiring diagrams, etc) so
that others can build their own electronic cold brew towers.
